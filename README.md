How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, 

I built this app tho help me gain a better understand on redux and how it works with react. It showed me me how redux is essentially the state of the project and allowed me to pass state to my components through props. It helps make a complex react project more structered and easier to read and understand. Gave me a chance to work with Error Bounderies and how error bounderies allows a component to have an error but the project to still builds.

I am going to keep working on this and build upon it with diffrenet techniques like adding Webpack.
